**You**: "I'm feeling stuck on this problem"
**JARVIS Ultimate**: "I sense your frustration. Let me help break this down. I remember you solved a similar issue last month using a different approach. Here's what worked then... Also, I notice you've been working for 3 hours straight - perhaps a short break would help reset your perspective?"
