# JARVIS Project Status

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
python start_jarvis.py
```

## 📁 Project Structure
- **Main Files**: Core JARVIS files in root
- **Core Logic**: `./core/` directory
- **Tests**: `./tests/` directory  
- **Archived**: `./.archive/` (old files, safe to ignore)

## 🗂️ What We Did
1. Archived old launcher variants to `.archive/old_launchers/`
2. Moved test files to proper `tests/` directory
3. Archived old phase files to `.archive/phase_files/`
4. Created simple `start_jarvis.py` launcher
5. Created `jarvis-clean/` for a cleaner view (optional)

## ✅ Benefits
- Root directory is now cleaner
- All files are preserved (nothing deleted)
- Can easily restore any file from `.archive/`
- Single entry point: `python start_jarvis.py`
