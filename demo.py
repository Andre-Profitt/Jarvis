JARVIS Natural Interaction Examples:

ðŸŽ¤ Morning:
   You: *just start talking* "Open my email and check the weather"
   JARVIS: "Good morning! Opening Mail for you. It's currently 68Â°F and sunny."

ðŸŽ¤ Working:
   You: "Hey JARVIS"
   JARVIS: "Yes?"
   You: "I need to calculate 18% tip on $127.50"
   JARVIS: "That would be $22.95, making your total $150.45"
   You: "Thanks, also set a reminder for lunch at noon"
   JARVIS: "I'll remind you about lunch at noon."

ðŸŽ¤ Natural Flow:
   You: "Search for the best coffee shops nearby"
   JARVIS: "I'm searching for coffee shops in your area..."
   You: "Actually, make that tea shops"
   JARVIS: "Switching to tea shops instead..."

ðŸŽ¤ Context Aware:
   You: "What was that calculation again?"
   JARVIS: "The 18% tip on $127.50 was $22.95"

NO COMMANDS. NO MODES. JUST CONVERSATION.
