## 🛠️ Configuration Tuning

### config.json Options
```json
{
  "performance": {
    "cache_size": 5000,          // Increase for more caching
    "thread_workers": 0,         // 0 = auto-detect
    "monitoring_interval": 1.0,  // Seconds between metric collection
    "memory_threshold": 0.8,     // Trigger GC at 80% memory
    "cpu_threshold": 0.7,        // Scale down at 70% CPU
    "batch_size": 10,           // Task batch size
    "batch_timeout": 0.1        // Batch timeout in seconds
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Performance tuning
JARVIS_CACHE_SIZE=10000          # Larger cache
JARVIS_THREAD_WORKERS=16         # More workers
JARVIS_MONITORING_INTERVAL=0.5   # Faster monitoring

# Neural network
JARVIS_GPU_ENABLED=true          # Use GPU if available
JARVIS_BATCH_SIZE=64            # Larger training batches
```

## 📈 Monitoring & Debugging

### Performance Dashboard
- Real-time metrics in `jarvis_optimized.log`
- JSON reports in `performance_report.json`
- Bottleneck alerts in console

### Key Metrics to Watch
1. **Cache Hit Rate**: Should be >70%
2. **Response Time P95**: Should be <500ms
3. **Memory Usage**: Should stay <80%
4. **CPU Usage**: Should average <60%

### Troubleshooting

#### High Memory Usage
```bash
# Check for memory leaks
python3 -m memory_profiler launch_optimized_jarvis.py

# Force garbage collection
# Set JARVIS_GC_INTERVAL=30 in .env
```

#### Slow Response Times
```bash
# Enable profiling
JARVIS_PROFILE=true ./start_jarvis_optimized.sh

# Check bottlenecks in performance_report.json
```

#### CPU Spikes
```bash
# Reduce thread workers
JARVIS_THREAD_WORKERS=4 ./start_jarvis_optimized.sh

# Disable GPU if causing issues
./start_jarvis_optimized.sh --no-neural
```

## 🚀 Best Practices

1. **Start with Default Settings**: The defaults are optimized for most systems
2. **Monitor First Week**: Watch metrics to understand your usage patterns
3. **Tune Gradually**: Adjust one parameter at a time
4. **Use GPU When Available**: 5-10x performance boost for neural operations
5. **Regular Model Saves**: Neural model saves every hour by default

## 🔮 Future Optimizations

- **Distributed Processing**: Multi-machine support
- **Model Quantization**: Smaller, faster neural models
- **Edge Deployment**: Optimize for low-power devices
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time text generation
- **Adaptive Optimization**: Self-tuning based on usage

## 📞 Support

If you experience performance issues:
1. Check `jarvis_optimized.log` for errors
2. Review `performance_report.json` for bottlenecks
3. Run with `--no-neural` or `--no-voice` to isolate issues
4. Adjust config.json based on this guide

Remember: Performance optimization is an iterative process. Start simple, measure everything, and optimize based on real data!
