I'm continuing development on JARVIS, my autonomous AI ecosystem. Here's the current context:

## Project Overview
JARVIS is a self-improving, self-healing AI system with neural resource management, quantum optimization, and multi-AI integration. It uses brain-inspired algorithms for 150x efficiency.

## Key Components
- Neural Resource Manager (150x efficiency)
- Self-Healing System (99.9% uptime)  
- LLM Research Integration (PhD-level)
- Quantum Swarm Optimization (25% gains)
- Multi-AI Orchestra (Claude, Gemini, GPT-4)
