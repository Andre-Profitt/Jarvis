  - Long-term Memory: Important memories (permanent)
  - Episodic & Semantic Memory types

- **Intelligent Memory Features**:
  - Topic-based indexing
  - Entity tracking and resolution
  - Memory consolidation
  - Relevance-based recall
  - Pattern recognition

- **Key Capabilities**:
  ```python
  # Add memories with context
  memory = await memory.add_memory(content, context, importance=0.8)
  
  # Intelligent recall
  related = await memory.recall("project details", context)
  
  # Memory consolidation
  await memory.consolidate_memories()
  ```

### 2. **Emotional Continuity System** (`core/emotional_continuity.py`)
- **Emotion Tracking**:
  - 9 primary emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, etc.)
  - Intensity, valence, and arousal dimensions
  - Smooth emotional transitions
  - Emotional trajectory prediction

- **Empathetic Response Generation**:
  - Tone adaptation
  - Energy level matching
  - Intervention detection
  - Emotional mirroring

- **User Baseline Learning**:
  - Typical emotional patterns
  - Recovery rates
  - Emotional range tracking

### 3. **Natural Language Flow Engine** (`core/natural_language_flow.py`)
- **Conversation Management**:
  - Natural acknowledgments
  - Smooth topic transitions
  - Interruption handling
  - Pronoun resolution

- **Response Styles**:
  - Formal/Casual/Technical/Empathetic
  - Personality injection
  - Verbosity control
  - Context-aware phrasing

- **Flow Features**:
  - Conversation threading
  - Reference tracking
  - Natural fillers and transitions
  - Style adaptation

### 4. **Natural Interaction Core** (`core/natural_interaction_core.py`)
- **Unified Integration**:
  - Combines all Phase 5 components
  - Integrates with Phase 1 pipeline
  - Manages interaction modes
  - Tracks conversation quality

- **Interaction Modes**:
  - Conversation
  - Task-focused
  - Learning
  - Creative
  - Crisis
  - Flow state

## üéØ Key Features Delivered

### 1. **Perfect Context Persistence**
```python
# JARVIS remembers everything relevant
User: "I'm working on that ML project"
JARVIS: "The TensorFlow image classifier? How's the accuracy now?"
```

### 2. **Emotional Intelligence**
```python
# JARVIS adapts to emotional states
User: "I'm frustrated with this bug!" 
JARVIS: "I understand how frustrating that can be. Let's tackle it step by step."
```

### 3. **Natural Conversation Flow**
```python
# Smooth topic transitions
User: "Fixed the bug. Oh, did you schedule that meeting?"
JARVIS: "Great job on the bug! Yes, I scheduled the meeting for 3 PM tomorrow."
```

### 4. **Interruption Handling**
```python
# Natural interruption management
User: "Can you explain how neural..."
User: "Actually, first check my emails"
JARVIS: "Sure, checking your emails now..."
```

### 5. **Personality Adaptation**
```python
# Adapts to user preferences
await jarvis.adapt_personality({"preferred_style": "casual"})
# JARVIS becomes more relaxed and friendly
```

---

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Conversation
```python
from core.natural_interaction_core import NaturalInteractionCore

jarvis = NaturalInteractionCore()

# Simple interaction
result = await jarvis.process_interaction(
    "How's my schedule looking today?"
)
print(result['response'])
```

### With Multimodal Input
```python
# Include voice and biometric data
result = await jarvis.process_interaction(
    "I'm feeling stressed about the deadline",
    multimodal_inputs={
        "voice": {"features": {"pitch_variance": 0.8}},
        "biometric": {"heart_rate": 95, "skin_conductance": 0.7}
    }
)
```

### Get Interaction Insights
```python
insights = await jarvis.get_interaction_insights()
print(f"Engagement: {insights['interaction_quality']['engagement_level']:.2%}")
print(f"Topics: {insights['conversation_topics']}")
```
