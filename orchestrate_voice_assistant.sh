1. VOICE RECOGNITION ENGINE:
   - Web Speech API integration
   - Real-time speech-to-text
   - Multi-language support
   - Noise cancellation
   - Wake word detection ('Hey JARVIS')

2. NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING:
   - Intent recognition system
   - Context-aware responses
   - Conversation memory
   - Emotion detection
   - Sarcasm and humor understanding

3. VOICE SYNTHESIS:
   - Natural-sounding TTS
   - Emotional voice modulation
   - JARVIS personality traits
   - Variable speech speed/pitch
   - Custom voice model

4. REAL-TIME FEATURES:
   - WebSocket voice streaming
   - <50ms response latency
   - Interrupt handling
   - Continuous listening mode
   - Background processing

5. 3D VOICE VISUALIZATION:
   - Three.js audio waveform
   - Holographic voice avatar
   - Lip-sync animation
   - Voice activity indicators
   - Spatial audio positioning

6. COMMAND SYSTEM:
   - Extensible plugin architecture
   - Smart home integration
   - Calendar/email management
   - Web search capabilities
   - Custom skill creation

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Web Speech API for recognition
- WebSocket for real-time
- Three.js for 3D visualization
- Zustand for state management
- Tailwind for styling

DELIVERABLES:
1. Voice recognition component
2. NLP processing pipeline
3. Voice synthesis engine
4. 3D avatar component
5. Command plugin system
6. Real-time WebSocket server
7. Complete voice UI/UX
