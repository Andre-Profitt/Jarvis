# JARVIS Next-Level AI Assistant Setup

## ðŸŽ¯ What We're Building
Based on the Nordic Fintech Week AI demo, we're creating a JARVIS that:
- **Monitors you in real-time** (video, audio, performance)
- **Proactively intervenes** without being asked
- **Knows your context** (schedule, health, preferences)
- **Coaches performance** in real-time
- **Anticipates needs** before you realize them

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. Install Required Components
```bash
# Core AI packages
pip3 install openai google-generativeai elevenlabs

# Real-time monitoring
pip3 install opencv-python deepface speechrecognition
pip3 install pyttsx3 websockets pandas numpy

# Additional requirements
pip3 install pyaudio mediapipe tensorflow
```

### 2. Launch the Proactive Interface
```bash
# Open the new proactive monitoring UI
open /Users/andreprofitt/CloudAI/JARVIS-ECOSYSTEM/jarvis-proactive-ui.html

# Run the backend system
python3 /Users/andreprofitt/CloudAI/JARVIS-ECOSYSTEM/jarvis_proactive_ai.py
```

## ðŸ’¡ Key Features Like Nordic Fintech AI

### Real-Time Performance Monitoring
- **Speaking pace analysis**: "You're 3% slower than rehearsal"
- **Emotion detection**: "You're tracking as lightly stressed"
- **Body language**: "Improved eyebrow lift needed"
- **Engagement scoring**: Real-time feedback on performance

### Proactive Intelligence
- **Schedule awareness**: "Paddle training in 42 minutes"
- **Health monitoring**: "The cheese cubes - you're lactose intolerant"
- **Break reminders**: Based on work patterns
- **Context switching**: Knows what you're doing

### Continuous Coaching
- **Content optimization**: "Videos under 60 seconds get 34% more engagement"
- **Tone adjustment**: "Current tone lacks emotional warmth"
- **Stress management**: "Breathe in through nose, out through mouth"
- **Performance improvement**: Specific, actionable feedback

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

### 1. Personalize Your Profile
Edit `jarvis_proactive_ai.py`:
```python
self.user_profile = {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "health": {
        "lactose_intolerant": True,  # Your restrictions
        "allergies": ["nuts"],
        "fitness_goals": "maintain stamina"
    },
    "preferences": {
        "video_length": 60,  # optimal seconds
        "speaking_pace": 150,  # WPM
        "work_hours": {"start": 9, "end": 18}
    }
}
```

### 2. Connect Calendar
```python
# Add your calendar events
jarvis.user_profile["schedule"] = {
    datetime(2025, 6, 29, 15, 42): "Meeting with team",
    datetime(2025, 6, 29, 17, 0): "Gym session",
}
```

### 3. Set Intervention Rules
```python
self.intervention_rules = {
    "stress_threshold": 0.7,  # When to intervene
    "break_interval": 90,  # Minutes between breaks
    "posture_warning": 0.6,  # Posture score threshold
}
```
