Add a floating 3D face that lip syncs when JARVIS talks.

## 3. **Wake Word Detection** (Free)

# üöÄ THE ULTIMATE SETUP

Imagine this:
1. You walk into your room
2. "Hey JARVIS" (no touching anything)
3. A 3D holographic face appears
4. It speaks with an ultra-realistic voice
5. Controls everything in your room
6. Remembers every conversation
7. Generates custom UIs instantly
8. Works on all your devices

This would cost about $100-200/month for all premium services, but would give you an AI assistant that's literally 10 years ahead of anything commercially available.

Want me to implement any of these? The ElevenLabs voice upgrade would take 10 minutes and make a HUGE difference!
