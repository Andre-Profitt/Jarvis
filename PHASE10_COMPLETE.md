## 💡 Key Features in Action

### 1. Multi-Modal Parallel Processing
```python
# All modalities processed simultaneously
result = await jarvis.process_input({
    'vision': image_data,
    'audio': audio_data,
    'text': text_data,
    'biometric': bio_data
})
# 4x faster than sequential!
```

### 2. Smart Caching
```python
@cached(ttl=3600, tier=CacheTier.L2_REDIS)
async def expensive_operation(data):
    # This will be cached for 1 hour
    return process_data(data)
```

### 3. Lazy Module Loading
```python
@lazy_load("heavy.module")
async def use_heavy_feature():
    # Module loaded only when this function is called
    return heavy.module.process()
```

### 4. Automatic JIT Compilation
```python
@auto_compile()
def compute_intensive_task(data):
    # Automatically compiled after 100 calls
    return complex_computation(data)
```

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Custom Performance Config
```python
config = PerformanceConfig(
    enable_parallel_processing=True,
    enable_intelligent_caching=True,
    enable_lazy_loading=True,
    enable_jit_compilation=True,
    cache_size_mb=200,  # Larger cache
    parallel_workers=16,  # More workers
    memory_threshold=0.7,  # More aggressive
    jit_threshold=50  # Compile sooner
)
```

### Fine-tuning Cache Tiers

# Configure Redis connection
cache = IntelligentCache(
    redis_url="redis://localhost:6379",
    disk_path="/fast-ssd/jarvis_cache.db"
)
```

### Custom Module Registration

    features=["custom_feature"]
)
```

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Parallel isn't always faster** - Small tasks have overhead
2. **Cache invalidation is hard** - But predictive warming helps
3. **JIT compilation needs warmup** - Plan for initial latency
4. **Memory vs Speed tradeoff** - Tune for your use case
5. **Monitoring is essential** - Can't optimize what you can't measure
