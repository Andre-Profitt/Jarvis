# Ray Decorator Issue Fix

## Problem
The `world_class_swarm.py` file had an issue where it would fail with `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'remote'` when Ray was not installed.

## Root Cause
When Ray is not available, the code sets `ray = None`, but then tries to use `ray.remote()` which fails because `None` has no `remote` attribute.

## Solution
Added additional checks to ensure `ray is not None` before using any Ray methods:

### 1. Agent Creation (Line ~687)
```python
# Before:
if RAY_AVAILABLE:
    agent = ray.remote(SwarmAgent).remote(agent_id, agent_type, capabilities)

# After:
if RAY_AVAILABLE and ray is not None:
    RemoteSwarmAgent = ray.remote(SwarmAgent)
    agent = RemoteSwarmAgent.remote(agent_id, agent_type, capabilities)
```

### 2. Ray Initialization (Line ~861)
```python
# Before:
if RAY_AVAILABLE:
    ray.init(ignore_reinit_error=True)

# After:
if RAY_AVAILABLE and ray is not None:
    ray.init(ignore_reinit_error=True)
```

### 3. Ray Get Operations (Line ~783)
```python
# Before:
if RAY_AVAILABLE:
    results = await asyncio.gather(*[ray.get(t) for t in tasks])

# After:
if RAY_AVAILABLE and ray is not None:
    results = await asyncio.gather(*[ray.get(t) for t in tasks])
```

### 4. Ray Shutdown (Line ~909)
```python
# Before:
if RAY_AVAILABLE:
    ray.shutdown()

# After:
if RAY_AVAILABLE and ray is not None:
    ray.shutdown()
```

## Additional Improvements
- Added logging to indicate whether Ray is available or not
- Cleaned up duplicate logger definitions
- Made the Ray import handling more robust

## Testing
The fix has been tested and verified to work correctly both with and without Ray installed. The swarm system now gracefully falls back to local execution when Ray is not available.

## Usage
No changes needed for users. The system automatically detects if Ray is available and uses it for distributed computing, or falls back to local execution if not.
