# JARVIS Phase 3: Integration Guide

## üß† Phase 3 Overview

Phase 3 transforms JARVIS into a truly intelligent system with:

### 1. **Context Persistence**
- Maintains conversation threads across interactions
- Tracks ongoing activities (coding, research, communication)
- Learns user preferences and patterns
- Preserves context even after restarts

### 2. **Predictive Pre-loading**
- Learns from action patterns
- Predicts next likely actions with confidence scores
- Pre-loads resources before they're needed
- Identifies and learns common workflows

### 3. **Enhanced Memory Integration**
- Seamless integration with episodic memory system
- Context-aware memory retrieval
- Automatic memory formation from interactions
- Multi-strategy recall (associative, temporal, emotional, semantic)

## üì¶ Components

### Core Files
- `context_persistence_manager.py` - Manages conversation and activity contexts
- `predictive_preloading_system.py` - Handles predictions and resource pre-loading
- `memory_enhanced_processing.py` - Integrates everything with JARVIS core
- `test_jarvis_phase3.py` - Comprehensive tests and demos

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Basic Integration

```python
from core.jarvis_enhanced_core import JARVISEnhancedCore
from core.memory_enhanced_processing import enhance_jarvis_with_phase3

# Create or get your JARVIS instance
jarvis = JARVISEnhancedCore()
await jarvis.initialize()

# Enhance with Phase 3 capabilities
phase3 = await enhance_jarvis_with_phase3(jarvis)

# Now JARVIS has new methods:
# - jarvis.process_with_memory()
# - jarvis.recall()
# - jarvis.get_predictions()
# - jarvis.get_context_state()
# - jarvis.get_intelligence()
```

### 2. Memory-Enhanced Processing

```python
# Process input with full context and memory
result = await jarvis.process_with_memory(
    "Let's work on the neural network optimization",
    input_type="text",
    metadata={"activity_type": "coding"}
)

# Access results
print(f"Thread: {result.context.get('conversation_thread').topic}")
print(f"Activity: {result.context.get('current_activity').activity_type}")
print(f"Predictions: {len(result.predictions)}")
print(f"Memory used: {result.memory_utilized}")
```

### 3. Memory Recall

```python
# Recall relevant memories
memories = await jarvis.recall(
    "How did we solve the optimization problem?",
    strategy="associative",  # or "temporal", "emotional", "semantic"
    max_results=5
)

for memory in memories:
    print(f"Memory: {memory.chunks[0].content}")
    print(f"Importance: {memory.importance_score}")
```

### 4. Predictions

```python
# Get active predictions
predictions = await jarvis.get_predictions()

for pred in predictions:
    print(f"Predicted: {pred['content']}")
    print(f"Confidence: {pred['confidence']*100:.0f}%")
    print(f"Time window: {pred['time_remaining']}s")
```

## üéØ Use Cases

### 1. **Coding Assistant**
```python
# JARVIS learns your coding patterns
await jarvis.process_with_memory("Open main.py")
await jarvis.process_with_memory("Add error handling to the API endpoint")
await jarvis.process_with_memory("Save file")
# JARVIS predicts: You'll likely run tests next and pre-loads test framework
```

### 2. **Research Helper**
```python
# JARVIS maintains research context
await jarvis.process_with_memory("Research quantum computing applications")
await jarvis.process_with_memory("Focus on quantum machine learning")
# JARVIS retrieves previous research memories and suggests related papers
```

### 3. **Project Management**
```python
# JARVIS tracks project activities
await jarvis.process_with_memory("Working on Phase 3 implementation")
await jarvis.process_with_memory("Need to add documentation")
# JARVIS maintains project context and reminds of related tasks
```

## üìä Intelligence Metrics

```python
# Get comprehensive intelligence insights
insights = await jarvis.get_intelligence()

print(f"Intelligence Score: {insights['intelligence_score']}/100")
print(f"Memory Hit Rate: {insights['processing_performance']['memory_hit_rate']*100:.0f}%")
print(f"Prediction Accuracy: {insights['processing_performance']['prediction_accuracy']*100:.0f}%")
print(f"Learned Patterns: {insights['predictive_insights']['learned_patterns']}")
```

## üîß Configuration

### Context Persistence Settings
```python
# In context_persistence_manager.py
persistence_path = "./context_persistence"  # Where contexts are saved
conversation_timeout = 3600  # 1 hour - threads timeout after this
activity_timeout = 1800  # 30 minutes - activities timeout after this
```

### Predictive System Settings
```python
# In predictive_preloading_system.py
cache_size = 1000  # Maximum cached predictions
prediction_window = timedelta(minutes=5)  # How far ahead to predict
pattern_min_frequency = 3  # Minimum occurrences to learn pattern
```

### Memory Settings
```python
# In enhanced_episodic_memory.py
working_memory_capacity = 7  # Miller's magic number
consolidation_interval = timedelta(hours=6)  # How often to consolidate
retention_threshold = 0.1  # Minimum retention probability
```

## üß™ Testing

### Run All Tests
```bash
python test_jarvis_phase3.py
```

### Run Interactive Demo
```bash
python test_jarvis_phase3.py interactive
```

### Test Specific Features
```python
# Test context persistence
tester = Phase3Tester()
await tester.setup()
await tester.test_context_persistence()

# Test predictions
await tester.test_predictive_preloading()

# Test memory
await tester.test_memory_integration()
```

## üìà Performance Tips

### 1. **Memory Management**
- Memories are automatically consolidated every 6 hours
- Old, unimportant memories are gradually forgotten
- Important or frequently accessed memories are strengthened

### 2. **Prediction Optimization**
- Patterns need 3+ occurrences to be learned
- Predictions improve with more interactions
- Resource pre-loading is limited to top 10 predictions

### 3. **Context Efficiency**
- Inactive threads are archived after 24 hours
- Activities timeout after 2 hours of inactivity
- Context state is saved every 5 minutes

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Low Intelligence Score
**Solution**: The system needs time to learn. After 50+ interactions, scores improve significantly.

### Issue: Predictions Not Working
**Solution**: Check if patterns are being saved:
```python
metrics = await jarvis.get_intelligence()
print(f"Patterns learned: {metrics['predictive_insights']['learned_patterns']}")
```

### Issue: Memory Not Persisting
**Solution**: Ensure persistence is enabled:
```python
# Check memory system
memory_stats = jarvis.memory_system.get_memory_statistics()
print(f"Total memories: {memory_stats['total_memories']}")
```

### Issue: Context Switching Too Often
**Solution**: Adjust user preferences:
```python
jarvis.context_manager.user_preferences.interruption_threshold = 0.8  # Higher = less interruption
```

## üé® Customization

### Custom Prediction Types
```python
from core.predictive_preloading_system import PredictionType

# Add custom prediction type
class CustomPredictionType(PredictionType):
    CUSTOM_ACTION = auto()
```

### Custom Memory Strategies
```python
from core.enhanced_episodic_memory import RetrievalStrategy

# Add custom retrieval strategy
class CustomStrategy(RetrievalStrategy):
    CUSTOM_RECALL = auto()
```

### Custom Workflows
```python
# Define custom workflow template
custom_workflow = {
    "workflow_id": "custom_deploy",
    "name": "Custom Deployment",
    "steps": [
        {"action": "run_tests", "typical_delay": 30},
        {"action": "build_docker", "typical_delay": 60},

}
```
