# Claude Desktop + Claude Code Unification Guide

## Goal: Make Claude Desktop and Claude Code Work as One Team

### 1. **Shared Memory via MCP** (Most Important!)

Set up a unified MCP server that both can access:

```bash
# Install the MCP server we created
claude mcp add jarvis-memory python /Users/andreprofitt/CloudAI/JARVIS-ECOSYSTEM/mcp_servers/jarvis_memory_storage_mcp.py
```

Then in conversations:
- **Claude Desktop**: "Store this design in @jarvis-memory"
- **Claude Code**: "Retrieve the design from @jarvis-memory"

### 2. **Shared File System**

Create a shared workspace structure:

```
JARVIS-ECOSYSTEM/
├── artifacts/          # Claude Desktop saves artifacts here
│   ├── designs/       # Architecture designs
│   ├── prototypes/    # Code prototypes
│   └── conversations/ # Exported conversations
├── handoff/           # Active handoff files
│   ├── todo.md       # Current tasks
│   ├── context.md    # Current context
│   └── implement/    # Files ready for implementation
└── shared_memory/     # Shared knowledge base
    ├── decisions.md  # Design decisions
    ├── patterns.md   # Code patterns
    └── progress.md   # Project progress
```

### 3. **Context Handoff Protocol**

Create a standardized handoff format:

```markdown
# HANDOFF: [Task Name]
Date: [timestamp]
From: Claude Desktop
To: Claude Code

## Context
[What we're building and why]

## Current State
[What's been done so far]

## Implementation Needed
[Specific files and changes needed]

## Artifacts
- Location: artifacts/designs/feature-x.md
- Related files: [list]

## Memory References
- @jarvis-memory: "feature-x-design"
- @jarvis-memory: "api-decisions"
```

### 4. **Workflow Automation**

Create scripts to automate handoffs:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# scripts/handoff.py
"""
Automate handoff between Claude Desktop and Claude Code
"""

import json
from datetime import datetime
from pathlib import Path

class ClaudeHandoff:
    def __init__(self):
        self.handoff_dir = Path("handoff")
        self.handoff_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
    
    def create_handoff(self, task_name: str, context: str, 
                      artifacts: list, implementation: str):
        """Create a handoff file for Claude Code"""
        
        handoff = {
            "task": task_name,
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
            "from": "Claude Desktop",
            "to": "Claude Code",
            "context": context,
            "artifacts": artifacts,
            "implementation": implementation,
            "status": "pending"
        }
        
        # Save as JSON for parsing
        json_file = self.handoff_dir / f"{task_name}.json"
        with open(json_file, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(handoff, f, indent=2)
        
        # Save as Markdown for reading
        md_file = self.handoff_dir / f"{task_name}.md"
        with open(md_file, 'w') as f:
            f.write(f"# HANDOFF: {task_name}\n")
            f.write(f"Date: {handoff['timestamp']}\n\n")
            f.write(f"## Context\n{context}\n\n")
            f.write(f"## Artifacts\n")
            for artifact in artifacts:
                f.write(f"- {artifact}\n")
            f.write(f"\n## Implementation\n{implementation}\n")
        
        print(f"Handoff created: {json_file}")
        return handoff
    
    def complete_handoff(self, task_name: str, result: str):
        """Mark handoff as complete"""
        json_file = self.handoff_dir / f"{task_name}.json"
        
        if json_file.exists():
            with open(json_file, 'r') as f:
                handoff = json.load(f)
            
            handoff["status"] = "completed"
            handoff["completed_at"] = datetime.now().isoformat()
            handoff["result"] = result
            
            with open(json_file, 'w') as f:
                json.dump(handoff, f, indent=2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    handoff = ClaudeHandoff()
    
    # Example usage
    handoff.create_handoff(
        task_name="implement-neural-cache",
        context="Adding neural caching system to improve response times",
        artifacts=["artifacts/designs/neural-cache.md"],
        implementation="Create core/neural_cache.py with LRU cache"
    )
```

### 5. **Shared Configuration**

Both Claudes read from the same config:

```yaml
# config/claude_shared.yaml
claude_integration:
  shared_memory:
    enabled: true
    mcp_server: "jarvis-memory"
  
  handoff:
    auto_detect: true
    directory: "./handoff"
  
  artifacts:
    save_location: "./artifacts"
    auto_implement: false
  
  context_sharing:
    export_conversations: true
    import_on_startup: true
```

### 6. **Quick Unification Commands**

Add these to your workflow:

```bash
# In Claude Desktop:
"Save this design to @jarvis-memory as 'feature-x-design' and create artifact at artifacts/designs/feature-x.md"

# In Claude Code:
"Check handoff/ for new tasks and retrieve 'feature-x-design' from @jarvis-memory"

# Quick context share:
"Export our conversation to artifacts/conversations/[date]-feature-x.md"
```

### 7. **Best Practices for Unification**

1. **Start Sessions with Context**:
   ```
   "Check @jarvis-memory for recent context and handoff/ for pending tasks"
   ```

2. **End Sessions with Summary**:
   ```
   "Store session summary in @jarvis-memory as 'session-[date]' and update progress.md"
   ```

3. **Use Consistent Naming**:
   - Features: `feature-[name]`
   - Bugs: `bug-[issue-number]`
   - Designs: `design-[component]`

4. **Regular Sync Points**:
   - After each major design → Create handoff
   - After each implementation → Update memory
   - Daily → Sync progress file

### 8. **Advanced Unification (Future)**

Once MCP is fully configured:

```python
# Both Claudes could share:
- Real-time memory updates
- Shared conversation context  
- Unified knowledge base
- Synchronized task queue
- Common decision log
```

### 9. **Immediate Steps**

1. **Set up MCP memory server** (already created)
2. **Create handoff directory structure**
3. **Test memory sharing between instances**
4. **Establish naming conventions**
5. **Create first handoff as template**

## The Goal: Seamless Collaboration

With this setup, you can:
- Design in Claude Desktop → Implement in Claude Code
- Share memory and context between sessions
- Track progress across both tools
- Maintain consistency in the JARVIS project

Think of it as two developers with shared memory, working on the same codebase!
