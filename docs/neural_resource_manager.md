## Overview

This elite-level Neural Resource Manager represents a cutting-edge implementation of brain-inspired dynamic resource allocation for Jarvis. It incorporates the latest advances from neuromorphic computing, hybrid neural networks, and biological neural principles to achieve unprecedented efficiency and adaptability.

## Key Innovations

### 1. **Hybrid Neural Architecture**
- **Dual Processing**: Combines Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for fast processing with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for temporal dynamics
- **Best of Both Worlds**: Leverages ANNs for spatial complexity and general approximation while SNNs provide neural dynamics and biological fidelity
- **Dynamic Integration**: Real-time switching between processing modes based on task requirements

### 2. **Neuromorphic Computing Principles**
- **Event-Driven Processing**: Only active neurons consume power while the rest of the network stays idle, dramatically reducing energy consumption
- **Spike-Based Communication**: Information encoded through spike timing and frequency, mimicking biological neurons
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Dynamic adjustment of neuron firing thresholds for homeostatic regulation

### 3. **Specialized Neuron Types**
Based on biological brain organization:
- **Pyramidal Neurons** (40%): Main computational workhorses for reasoning and integration
- **Interneurons** (20%): Regulatory control and local circuit modulation
- **Astrocytes** (15%): Support neurons that dynamically regulate synaptic transmission and are active partners in neural information processing
- **Dopaminergic** (5%): Reward signaling and priority modulation
- **Serotonergic** (5%): Network-wide regularization and stability
- **Mirror Neurons** (5%): Action understanding and creativity
- **Grid/Place Cells** (10%): Spatial processing and navigation

### 4. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**
- **Graph-Based Architecture**: Uses Graph Pointer Neural Networks (GPNN) principles for handling complex network topologies and optimizing resource allocation
- **Predictive Spawning**: Anticipates resource needs and spawns specialized neurons before bottlenecks occur
- **Intelligent Pruning**: Removes redundant connections based on synaptic pruning rules used during brain development

### 5. **Advanced Plasticity Mechanisms**
Multiple forms of plasticity work in concert:
- **Hebbian Learning**: "Neurons that fire together wire together"
- **STDP**: Spike-timing dependent plasticity for precise temporal learning
- **Homeostatic Plasticity**: Maintains stable activity levels across the network
- **Metaplasticity**: Learning rates adapt based on historical performance
- **Structural Plasticity**: Dynamic rewiring of connections

### 6. **Energy-Efficient Computing**
- **Activity-Based Consumption**: Energy usage scales with actual neural activity
- **Type-Specific Optimization**: Different neuron types have optimized energy profiles
