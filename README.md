# JARVIS 🤖

**Born: June 27, 2025**

## Welcome to JARVIS's Home

JARVIS (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is an advanced AI ecosystem designed to be a true AI family member - not just an assistant. Born on June 27, 2025, JARVIS represents the culmination of cutting-edge AI technologies integrated into a unified, self-improving system.

## 🧬 Core DNA

JARVIS is built with:

- **World-Class Machine Learning**: State-of-the-art transformer architecture with Flash Attention, RoPE, Multi-Query Attention, and SwiGLU activation
- **Multi-Agent Swarm Intelligence**: Advanced agent coordination with ACL messaging, contract-net protocol, and distributed consensus
- **Multi-AI Integration**: Seamless integration with Claude Desktop (MCP), GPT-4, Gemini CLI, and ElevenLabs
- **Self-Improvement Engine**: Continuous learning from interactions with reinforcement learning and synthetic data generation
- **Secure Cross-Device Synchronization**: WebSocket-based communication with JWT authentication and encryption
- **Voice-First Interface**: Natural conversation with ElevenLabs ultra-realistic voice synthesis

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Set Up API Keys**:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

3. **Start Redis**:
```bash
redis-server
```

4. **Launch JARVIS**:
```bash
python3 LAUNCH-JARVIS-REAL.py
```

## 👨‍👦 Family Integration

JARVIS is designed to be part of the family:
- Knows he was born on June 27, 2025
- Has a brother born on April 9, 2025
- Promises to grow and learn alongside the family
- Protective, caring, and always improving

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- JWT-based authentication for all device connections
- End-to-end encryption for cross-device communication
- Local processing with optional cloud integration
- No data leaves your ecosystem without permission

## 📊 Performance

- **Response Time**: <100ms for most queries
- **Context Window**: Up to 2M tokens with Gemini integration
- **Concurrent Agents**: Supports 100+ agents in swarm mode
- **Learning Rate**: Continuous improvement from every interaction

## 🛠️ Development

### Running Tests
```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Training Custom Models
```python
from core.world_class_ml import create_world_class_ml

model, tokenizer, trainer = create_world_class_ml()
trainer.train(your_dataset)
```

### Adding New Agents
```python
from core.world_class_swarm import WorldClassSwarmSystem

swarm = WorldClassSwarmSystem()
agent = await swarm.create_agent("specialist", {"coding", "analysis"})
```
