- Sessions linked to specific projects
- Full context preserved including:
  - Working directory (`cwd`)
  - Timestamps
  - Tool calls (file reads, bash commands, etc.)
  - Session IDs for grouping related interactions

### 3. **GitHub Integration** ‚úÖ
- Local repository tracking
- 30-minute automated sync
- Commit history analysis
- Cross-project dependency detection

### 4. **Project File Structure** ‚úÖ

3. **mcp-audio-tools** - 9 Claude Code + podcast processing
4. **medical-marketplace** - Backend/frontend development
5. **linkedin-automation** - AppleScript automation
6. **affiliate-mcp-server** - MCP server development
7. **CloudAI** - Cloud integrations
8. **Plus 11 more projects...**

## üöÄ Usage Commands

### Quick Access
```bash
# View unified dashboard
jarvis-dashboard

# View specific project memory
jarvis-project aws-cost-optimization

# Sync Claude Code history
cd ~/.jarvis_memory && python3 sync_claude_code.py

# Manual project scan
~/.jarvis_memory/scan_projects.sh
```

### Python API
```python
from unified_memory import UnifiedMemorySystem
from claude_code_integration import ClaudeCodeIntegration

# Access unified memory
memory = UnifiedMemorySystem()

# Get project context (includes Claude Code history)
context = memory.get_project_context("mcp-audio-tools")

# Search across all sources
results = memory.search_memory("podcast transcription")

# Add new insight
memory.add_insight(
    "mcp-audio-tools",
    "solution",
    "Optimal Processing",
    "Use whisper-large-v3 for best accuracy"
)
```

## üîç What's Captured

### From Terminal:
- Command executed
- Working directory
- Exit code
- Timestamp
- Auto-categorized project

### From Claude Code:
- User prompts/commands
- Claude's responses
- Tool usage (file operations, bash commands)
- Session context
- Working directory
- Full conversation flow

### From GitHub:
- Repository URLs
- Last commit info
- Project relationships

## üéØ Key Features

1. **Unified Search** - Search across terminal, Claude Code, and GitHub
2. **Cross-Project Insights** - Identify patterns across projects
3. **Context Preservation** - Full history with timestamps
4. **Automatic Categorization** - Smart project detection
5. **Export Capabilities** - Markdown reports per project

## üìà Growth Over Time

The system learns and improves by:
- Identifying command patterns
- Linking related projects
- Building a knowledge graph
- Preserving solutions and fixes
- Tracking tool usage patterns

## üîí Privacy & Security

- All data stored locally in `~/.jarvis_memory`
- No external API calls (except GitHub sync)
- SQLite database can be encrypted
- Sensitive data can be excluded

## üéâ Next Steps

1. **Let it learn** - The more you work, the smarter it gets
2. **Add insights** - Document solutions as you find them
3. **Review patterns** - Check the dashboard weekly
4. **Export knowledge** - Generate project documentation

## üí° Pro Tips

### Finding Past Solutions
```sql
sqlite3 ~/.jarvis_memory/unified_memory.db "
SELECT p.name, a.content, a.timestamp
FROM actions a
JOIN projects p ON a.project_id = p.id
WHERE a.content LIKE '%error%'
AND a.tags LIKE '%claude_code%'
ORDER BY a.timestamp DESC
"
```

### Viewing Claude Code Conversations
```bash
# See all Claude Code sessions for a project
sqlite3 ~/.jarvis_memory/unified_memory.db "
SELECT content, timestamp
FROM actions
WHERE project_id = (SELECT id FROM projects WHERE name = 'mcp-audio-tools')
AND tags LIKE '%claude_code%'
ORDER BY timestamp
"
```

### Creating Knowledge Exports
```python
# Export all learnings for documentation
for project in ['aws-cost-optimization', 'medical-marketplace']:
    memory.export_project_memory(project)
```

---

Your Jarvis memory system is now capturing EVERYTHING:
- ‚úÖ Terminal commands
- ‚úÖ Claude Code conversations  
- ‚úÖ GitHub activity
- ‚úÖ Project structures

The system will continue to grow smarter with every command, every Claude Code session, and every project you work on! üöÄ
