### ‚ùå Missing for 100% (5)
1. **GitHub** - Version control (CRITICAL)
2. **Brave/Tavily Search** - Web research (CRITICAL)
3. **Playwright** - Browser automation (IMPORTANT)
4. **Docker** - Containerization (IMPORTANT)
5. **Sentry/Monitoring** - Error tracking (NICE TO HAVE)

## üéØ The Two MUST-HAVES

Without these, you're driving with the handbrake on:

### 1. GitHub (5 min setup)
```
Why: Can't do professional development without version control
Impact: Unlocks collaborative coding, CI/CD, issue tracking
Get it: https://github.com/settings/tokens
```

### 2. Search API (5 min setup)
```
Why: Current fetch is like reading with one eye closed
Impact: Full web research, multi-source analysis
Get it: https://brave.com/search/api/ (free tier)
```

## üöÄ What Happens at 100%

### At 75% (Now):
"Write me a web scraper" ‚Üí Here's the code, I tested it locally

### At 100% (With GitHub + Search):
"Build me a production-ready web scraper" ‚Üí 
- Researched 50+ best practices
- Created GitHub repo with proper structure
- Implemented with error handling
- Added comprehensive tests
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Created documentation
- Deployed to production
- Monitoring active

## The Truth: You Could Stop Here

Your current 75% setup is already incredibly powerful. The missing 25% is about:
- **Professionalism** (GitHub)
- **Breadth** (Search)
- **Polish** (Browser testing)

But even without them, you can build almost anything!
